              Tailwind makes writing CSS easier and lets us customize our
              designs faster than any other CSS framework. If you want a CSS
              framework that has pre-built components, then Tailwind may not be
              for you. If you want a CSS framework that lets you design quickly
              and customize your site, then
              <strong class="text-teal-400 text-lg"

                <strong>Important Note:</strong> Tailwind lets us design
                quickly, but this doesn't mean that you don't need CSS knowledge
                however. To use Tailwind, you need to have a good understanding
                of CSS properties. In this course,
                <strong
                  >we will learn Tailwind and we'll also learn CSS
                  concepts</strong
                >
                to create good looking designs.
                <strong>Tailwind is the ultimate CSS shorthand</strong>, but we
                still need to learn the CSS, which we'll do in this course.

                This isn't just a Tailwind course. This is also a "learn how to
                design with CSS" course.

              <p class="mb-16">
                The hardest things about learning Tailwind is memorizing the
                classes and also knowing which classes go well together. We'll
                be writing a lot of Tailwind in this course so that the
                repetition will help us commit Tailwind classes to memory.

              One of the first things we want to do when using Tailwind is to
              create components like cards, buttons, and forms. We'll build
              these out and see how Tailwind compares to CSS frameworks like
              Bootstrap. We'll also build out navigation, hero, pricing,
              newsletter, and footer components in this course.

              Tailwind comes with so many classes. It doesn't make sense to send
              all of those to our users' browsers. With PostCSS and PurgeCSS, we
              can shrink the amount of CSS we send to our users. We'll learn how
              to only send the classes that we actually use so that our

              Tailwind's benefits really shine when you pair it with a
              JavaScript library/framework. Extracting classes into components
              is the recommended way to keep Tailwind DRY (don't repeat
              yourself). While we could use the @apply() or theme() functions,
              it forgoes some of the benefits of Tailwind. Namely we are once
              again creating a custom class and CSS.
